#### **📌 Step 2: Enable Firestore Database**
1. **Go to Firestore Database** in Firebase.
2. **Click "Create Database"** → Select **Start in Test Mode**.
3. **Click "Next"** and set the location.

#### **📌 Step 3: Download Firebase Credentials**
1. **Go to Firebase Console** → Click **Project Settings**.

            "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
        }
    },
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "Firebase": {
        "ProjectId": "your-firebase-project-id",
        "AuthFilePath": "firebase-config.json"
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Notes on Database Migration
- Initially, this project was **built using SQL LocalDB** as per the assignment.
- Later, we **migrated the database to Firebase Firestore** for:
  - **Better scalability**
  - **Easier setup (No need for migrations)**
  - **Cloud storage instead of local storage**
